* **Logo** - You can upload your sticky header logo by clicking on "Upload new" > "Select a file". Ideally, this **logo should be 30px** tall or it will be resized. If a logo image is not uploaded, site title will be used.
* **Background color** - You can choose your custom sticky header background color.
* **Text color** - Choose your sticky header text color so it provides enough contrast with regards to the background color.
* **Sticky Header max width** - This option allows you to match interior Sticky Header width to your content area width. 
* **Make visible when scrolled to** - This is the distance from the top of the page at which sticky header will show, in pixels.
